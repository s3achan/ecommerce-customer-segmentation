# 🛒 E-Commerce Cancellation & Customer Segmentation Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior and cancellation patterns using the Kaggle E-Commerce dataset.  
The goal is to identify key drivers of cancellations, quantify revenue impact, and segment high-risk customers to support data-driven business decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze overall cancellation rate
- Quantify revenue lost due to cancellations
- Identify high-risk products and customer segments
- Explore customer behavior patterns
- Build actionable business insights from transactional data

---

## 📊 Key Metrics Analyzed

- **Overall Cancellation Rate**
- **Revenue Lost from Cancellations**
- **Top Products by Cancellation Count**
- **Top Products by Revenue Impact**
- **Customer-Level Cancellation Rate**
- **Segment-Based Cancellation Trends**

---

## 📈 Sample Insights

- A small subset of products drives a disproportionate share of cancellation impact.
- Certain customer segments exhibit significantly higher cancellation rates.
- Revenue-weighted cancellation analysis provides stronger business insight than raw counts.
- High-value customers with frequent cancellations may require targeted retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn (for segmentation & modeling)

2. Feature Engineering (Total Price, Cancellation Flags)  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Cancellation Rate & Revenue Impact Analysis  
5. Customer-Level Behavioral Segmentation  
6. Visualization & Business Interpretation

## 💡 Business Value

This analysis helps answer:

- Which products contribute most to cancellation revenue loss?
- Which customer segments are high-risk?
- What is the financial impact of cancellations?
- Where should retention strategies be prioritized?
